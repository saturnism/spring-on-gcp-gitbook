# Vulnerability Scanning

[Cloud Container Analysis](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/container-analysis) can scan container images stored in Container Registry for vulnerabilities. See [Vulnerability Scanning documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/vulnerability-scanning) for more detail.

## Enable API

```bash
gcloud services enable containeranalysis.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containerscanning.googleapis.com
```

## Push an Image

Container images are scanned when they are pushed to Container Registry. To force a scan on an existing image, you can re-push the image. For example, follow the [Container Image section](container-image.md), and re-push the Hello World container image.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

./mvnw compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:2.4.0:build \
  -Dimage=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/helloworld
```

## Vulnerabilities

Once the image is scanned, you can see the status of Vulnerability Scanning in Container Registry.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

open https://gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/helloworld
```

On the right hand side, see the **Vulnerabilities** column:

Click into **View vulnerabilities** to see the details:

You can list vulnerabilities for a specific container image.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud beta container images describe gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/helloworld \
  --show-package-vulnerability
```

## Continuous Scan

Container images are scanned upon push to Container Registry, and then continuously monitored/scanned if the image was pulled in the last 30 days.
